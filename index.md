# about me

Hey! I'm Matthew Nemeth, currently an undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Bioengineering and Computer Science. I'm interested in medicine and am a **huge** water polo fan (one who's lucky enough to have bumped into DÃ©nes Varga in an airport). If you want, you can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewnemeth6).

This website is mostly going to serve as a thought dump, where I'm going to share interesting things I've read, heard, or thought about. Welcome and have a look around!
